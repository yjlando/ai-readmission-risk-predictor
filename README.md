# 🏥 AI Readmission Risk Predictor


## 📘 Overview

This project implements an AI system that predicts whether a patient will be readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of discharge. The work follows a structured AI Development Workflow, covering all stages from problem definition to deployment.

## 🔍 Use Case

Hospital administrators aim to reduce readmission rates to improve care quality and avoid financial penalties. This predictive system supports early interventions and helps clinicians prioritize patients at risk.



## 🧪 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed mock EHR data  
- Feature engineering based on patient discharge and chronic history  
- XGBoost classifier with precision and recall evaluation  
- Deployment-ready notebook for inference simulation  
- Fairness and ethics considerations built into model planning
